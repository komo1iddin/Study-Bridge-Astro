# Internationalization (i18n) Improvements

This document outlines the internationalization improvements implemented in the AstroStudy project.

## Key Improvements

### 1. More Efficient i18n Routing

- Changed from directory-based routing to prefix-based routing using Astro's `pathname-prefix-always` strategy
- Added support for automatic language detection and routing through middleware
- Implemented user language preference storage using localStorage

### 2. Enhanced Language Selection

- Added enhanced language selector component with keyboard navigation and shortcuts
- Included visual indicators for the current language
- Implemented proper aria attributes for accessibility

### 3. Translation Management Tools

- Created a translation management interface for content editors
- Added automatic translation suggestions for missing content
- Implemented translation statistics and completion tracking
- Enabled bulk translation management

```

### Configuration

The i18n configuration in `astro.config.mjs` has been updated to use the more efficient `pathname-prefix-always` strategy instead of the previous directory-based approach.

### Usage

#### For Users

- Automatic language detection based on browser preferences
- Language persistence between visits
- Improved language switch experience
- Keyboard shortcuts for language switching

#### For Content Editors

- Visit `/admin/translations` to manage translations (note: admin pages are accessible without language prefixes)
- View missing translations and their completion percentage
- Get automatic translation suggestions
- Bulk save or edit translations

## Future Improvements

1. Integrate with professional translation APIs (Google Translate, DeepL)
2. Add support for more languages
3. Implement translation memory for consistent translations
4. Create translation glossary for terminology consistency
